// [#protodoc-title: Dlb connection balancer configuration]
// DLB :ref:`configuration overview <config_connection_balance_dlb>`.
// [#extension: envoy.network.connection_balance.dlb]

// The Dlb is a hardware managed system of queues and arbiters connecting producers and consumers. It is a PCIE device
// in the CPU package. It interacts with software running on cores and potentially other devices. The Dlb implements the
// load balancing features outlined earlier, including the following:
// -  Lock-free multi-producer/multi-consumer operation.
// -  Multiple priorities for varying traffic types.
// -  Various distribution schemes.
//
// Dlb connection balancer uses Dlb hardware to balance connections. With it, the latency like P99 significantly reduces.
// Since Dlb connection balancer needs help of Dlb hardware, it should be used when there are big number connections
// (e.g., Gateway).
