- area: adaptive concurrency filter stats
  change: |
    Multiply the gradient value stat by 1000 to make it more granular (values will range between 500 and 2000).

# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*

new_features:
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    Added
    :ref:`metadata <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExtProcOverrides.metadata>`
    config API to allow extending inherited metadata from ExternalProcessor
    :ref:`grpc_service <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.grpc_service>`
    with the new or updated values.
- area: grpc reverse bridge
  change: |
    Change HTTP status to 200 to respect the gRPC protocol. This may cause problems for incorrect gRPC clients expecting the filter
    to preserve HTTP 1.1 responses.  This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.grpc_http1_reverse_bridge_change_http_status`` to false.
