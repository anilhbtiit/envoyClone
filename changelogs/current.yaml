  change: |
    Allow extended ASCII characters for HTTP/2 only in the default header validator. Extneded ASCII characters are URL encoded in the
    URL path and remain unencoded in query and fragment. This behavior can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.uhv_allow_extended_ascii_in_path_for_http2`` to false, in which case requests with extended ASCII in path,
    query or fragment are rejected. This setting is only applicable when the Unversal Header Validator is enabled and has no effect
    otherwise.
