new_features:
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    added :ref:`dubbo codec support <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.codecs.dubbo.v3.DubboCodecConfig>` to the
    :ref:`generic_proxy filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.v3.GenericProxy>`.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    added a new field :ref:`socket_options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.ExtraSourceAddress.socket_options>` to the ExtraSourceAddress, allowing specifying discrete socket options for each source address.

- area: http
  change: |
    added the expected :ref:`receive <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck.receive>` payload check for HTTP health check.
    Added :ref:`response_buffer_size <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck.response_buffer_size>` to configure the maximum HTTP health check response buffer size.
- area: lua
  change: |
    added new headers method "setHttp1ReasonPhrase" for lua filter, please see :ref:`lua header wrapper <config_http_filters_lua_header_wrapper>`.
- area: lua
  change: |
    added stats for lua filter, please see :ref:`lua filter stats <config_http_filters_lua_stats>`.
- area: subset load balancer
  change: |
    added multiple keys or multiple selectors support for :ref:`single host per subset mode <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.LbSubsetConfig.LbSubsetSelector.single_host_per_subset>`.
- area: listener
  change: |
    allow network filters other than HTTP Connection Manager to be created for QUIC listeners.
- area: lua
  change: |
    added an alternative function signature to ``httpCall()`` with ``options`` as an argument. This allows to skip sampling the produced trace span
    by setting ``{["trace_sampled"] = false}`` as the ``options``. And this allows to return multiple header values for same header name by setting
    ``{["return_duplicate_headers"] = true}`` as the ``options``.
- area: zipkin
  change: |
    added :ref:`split_spans_for_request <envoy_v3_api_field_config.trace.v3.ZipkinConfig.split_spans_for_request>` to make Envoy appear
    as an independent hop for zipkin tracing.
- area: cluster
  change: |
    added support to override original destination port via setting :ref:`upstream_port_override <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.OriginalDstLbConfig.upstream_port_override>`.
- area: generic_proxy
  change: |
    added an new network filter :ref:`generic_proxy filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.generic_proxy.v3.GenericProxy>`.
- area: redis
  change: |
    added support for quit command to the redis proxy.
- area: tcp_proxy
  change: |
    added support for propagating the response headers in :ref:`TunnelingConfig
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.TunnelingConfig.propagate_response_headers>` to
    the downstream info filter state.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    log ``duration``, ``upstream_request_attempt_count``, ``connection_termination_details`` and tls ``ja3`` field in the grpc access log
    and also log the tls ``sni`` and ``ja3`` field in the grpc access log when envoy is configured as a tls forward proxy.
- area: grpc_json_transcoder
  change: |
    added support for parsing enum value case insensitively enabled by the config :ref:`case_insensitive_enum_parsing <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.grpc_json_transcoder.v3.GrpcJsonTranscoder.case_insensitive_enum_parsing>`.
- area: udp_proxy
  change: |
    added support for :ref:`proxy_access_log <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.udp.udp_proxy.v3.UdpProxyConfig.proxy_access_log>`.
- area: grpc_json_transcoder
  change: |
