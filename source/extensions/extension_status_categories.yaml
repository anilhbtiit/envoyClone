security_postures:
  robust_to_untrusted_downstream: >
    This extension is intended to be robust against untrusted downstream
    traffic. It assumes that the upstream is trusted.
  robust_to_untrusted_downstream_and_upstream: >
    This extension is intended to be robust against both untrusted
    downstream and upstream traffic.
  requires_trusted_downstream_and_upstream: >
    This extension is not hardened and should only be used in
    deployments where both the downstream and upstream are trusted.
  unknown: >
    This extension has an unknown security posture and should only be
    used in deployments where both the downstream and upstream are
    trusted.
  data_plane_agnostic: >
    This extension does not operate on the data plane and hence is
    intended to be robust against untrusted traffic.

status_types:
  alpha: >
    This extension is functional but has not had substantial production
    burn time, use only with this caveat.
  wip: >
    This extension is work-in-progress. Functionality is incomplete and
    it is not intended for production use.
