behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: oauth2
  change: |
    OAuth filter now URL-encodes URL in query parameters. These query parameters are decoded, leaving intact character sequences that must remain encoded in URLs. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.oauth_use_url_encoding`` to false.

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: quic
  change: |
    Access logging is now deferred to the QUIC ack listener, and roundtrip response time is added as a downstream timing metric. New runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.quic_defer_logging_to_ack_listener`` can be used for revert this behavior.
- area: healthcheck
  change: |
    If active HC is enabled and a host is ejected by outlier detection, a successful active health check unejects the host and consider it healthy. This also clears all the outlier detection counters. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features_successful_active_health_check_uneject_host`` to ``false``.
- area: local_ratelimit
  change: |
    Tokens from local descriptor's token buckets are burned before tokens from the default token bucket.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Request authorities are now validated with a library function from QUICHE rather than nghttp2. This behavior change can be reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_validate_authority_with_quiche`` to ``false``.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: stats
  change: |
    now updating upstream total connection stats as happy eyeballs connections are created.
- area: eds
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.multiplex_eds`` to disable eds multiplexing. Eds multiplexing is enabled by default, so that all subscriptions for the same resource type and management server reuse a single channel/mux.
    When eds multiplexing is disabled each subscription uses a dedicated channel/mux.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed the bug that custom tags of the route metadata type are not set for upstream spans.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed outlier detection ejections caused by opened circuit breakers.
- area: dependency
  change: |
    Add boringssl patch to resolve CVE-2023-0286. Note that the FIPS build is not patched/fixed.
- area: access log
  change: |
    in JSON logs, port numbers were logged as strings and are now logged as numbers (``%DOWNSTREAM_LOCAL_PORT%``, ``%DOWNSTREAM_REMOTE_PORT%``, ``%DOWNSTREAM_DIRECT_REMOTE_PORT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_LOCAL_PORT%``, ``%UPSTREAM_REMOTE_PORT%``).
    This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.format_ports_as_numbers`` to false.

    of the new field :ref:`allowed_headers <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_authz.v3.ExtAuthz.allowed_headers>`.

- area: router
  change: |
    added a :ref:`x-envoy-is-timeout-retry <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-is-timeout-retry>` request header on retries initiated by request timeouts; enabled by setting :ref:`include_is_timeout_retry_header <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.VirtualHost.include_is_timeout_retry_header>` to ``true``.

    :ref:`cluster manager bind config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.ClusterManager.upstream_bind_config>` without specifying a
    :ref:`source_address <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.BindConfig.source_address>`. This allows setting
    :ref:`socket options <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.BindConfig.socket_options>` when using the default unspecified bind address
    is desired.
- area: xds
  change: |
    added an api configuration :ref:`xds_config_tracker_extension <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.xds_config_tracker_extension>` in the bootstrap
