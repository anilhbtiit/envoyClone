new_features:
- area: aws_request_signing
  change: |
    Update ``aws_request_signing`` filter to support use as an upstream HTTP filter. This allows successful calculation of
    signatures after the forwarding stage has completed, particularly if the path element is modified.
- area: grpc reverse bridge
  change: |
    Change HTTP status to 200 to respect the gRPC protocol. This may cause problems for incorrect gRPC clients expecting the filter
    to preserve HTTP 1.1 responses.  This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.grpc_http1_reverse_bridge_change_http_status`` to false.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    implemented
    :ref:`request_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.request_attributes>`
    and
    :ref:`response_attributes <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.response_attributes>`
    config APIs to enable sending and receiving attributes to/from the external processing server.
- area: access log
  change: |
    added support for :ref:`%UPSTREAM_CONNECTION_ID% <config_access_log_format_upstream_connection_id>` for the upstream connection
    identifier.
- area: ext_proc
  change: |
    added
    :ref:`metadata_options <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.ExternalProcessor.metadata_options>`
    config API to enable sending and receiving metadata from/to the external processing server. Both typed and untyped dynamic
    metadata may be sent to the server. If
    :ref:`receiving_namespaces <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3.MetadataOptions.receiving_namespaces>`
    is defined, returned metadata may be written to the specified allowed namespaces.
