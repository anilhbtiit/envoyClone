minor_behavior_changes:
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Fixed a reported issue (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/11004) that causes the Least
    Request load balancer policy to be unfair when the number of hosts are very small, when the number
    of hosts is smaller than the choice_count, instead of randomly selection hosts from the list, we
    perform a full scan on it to choose the host with least requests.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: xds
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/27702) that caused ADS initialization
    to fail on the first attempt and set a back-off retry interval of up to 1 second, if ADS is
    using an Envoy Cluster for the backend. The issue was fixed to ensure that ADS initialization
    happens after the Envoy Cluster it depends upon has been properly initialized. ADS that does
    not depend on an Envoy Cluster (i.e. GoogleGrpc) is not affected by this change.

new_features:
- area: upstream
  change: |
    Added :ref:`enable_full_scan <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.least_request.v3.LeastRequest>`
    option to the least requested load balancer. If set to true, Envoy will perform a full scan on the list of hosts
    instead of using :ref:`choice_count
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.load_balancing_policies.least_request.v3.LeastRequest>`
    to select the hosts.
