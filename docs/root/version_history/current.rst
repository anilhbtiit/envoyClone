1.20.0 (Pending)
================

Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* access_log: add new access_log command operator ``%REQUEST_TX_DURATION%``.
* access_log: remove extra quotes on metadata string values. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.unquote_log_string_values`` to false.
* admission control: added :ref:`admission control <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.admission_control.v3alpha.AdmissionControl.max_rejection_probability>` whose default value is 80%, which means that the upper limit of the default rejection probability of the filter is changed from 100% to 80%.
* aws_request_signing: requests are now buffered by default to compute signatures which include the
  payload hash, making the filter compatible with most AWS services. Previously, requests were
  never buffered, which only produced correct signatures for requests without a body, or for
  requests to S3, ES or Glacier, which used the literal string ``UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD``. Buffering can
  be now be disabled in favor of using unsigned payloads with compatible services via the new
  ``use_unsigned_payload`` filter option (default false).
* cluster: added default value of 5 seconds for :ref:`connect_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.connect_timeout>`.
* dns: changed apple resolver implementation to not reuse the UDS to the local DNS daemon.
* dns cache: the new :ref:`dns_query_timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_query_timeout>` option has a default of 5s. See below for more information.
* grpc: gRPC async client can be cached and shared accross filter instances in the same thread, this feature is turned off by default, can be turned on by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.enable_grpc_async_client_cache`` to true.
* http: disable the integration between :ref:`ExtensionWithMatcher <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.common.matching.v3.ExtensionWithMatcher>`
  and HTTP filters by default to reflects its experimental status. This feature can be enabled by seting
  ``envoy.reloadable_features.experimental_matching_api`` to true.
* http: replaced setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.strict_1xx_and_204_response_headers`` with settings
  ``envoy.reloadable_features.require_strict_1xx_and_204_response_headers``
  (require upstream 1xx or 204 responses to not have Transfer-Encoding or non-zero Content-Length headers) and
  ``envoy.reloadable_features.send_strict_1xx_and_204_response_headers``
  (do not send 1xx or 204 responses with these headers). Both are true by default.
* http: serve HEAD requests from cache.
* http: stop sending the transfer-encoding header for 304. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting
  ``envoy.reloadable_features.no_chunked_encoding_header_for_304`` to false.
* http: the behavior of the ``present_match`` in route header matcher changed. The value of ``present_match`` is ignored in the past. The new behavior is ``present_match`` performed when value is true. absent match performed when the value is false. Please reference :ref:`present_match
  <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.HeaderMatcher.present_match>`.
* listener: added an option when balancing across active listeners and wildcard matching is used to return the listener that matches the IP family type associated with the listener's socket address. Any unexpected behavioral changes can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.listener_wildcard_match_ip_family`` to false.
* listener: respect the :ref:`connection balance config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.listener.v3.Listener.connection_balance_config>`
  defined within the listener where the sockets are redirected to. Clear that field to restore the previous behavior.
* tcp: switched to the new connection pool by default. Any unexpected behavioral changes can be reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.new_tcp_connection_pool`` to false.
* tracing: add option :ref:`use_request_id_for_trace_sampling <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.request_id.uuid.v3.UuidRequestIdConfig.use_request_id_for_trace_sampling>` whether to use sampling policy based on :ref:`x-request-id<config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>` or not.
