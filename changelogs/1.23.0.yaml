behavior_changes:
- area: tls-inspector
  change: |
    the listener filter tls inspector's stats ``connection_closed`` and ``read_error`` are removed. The new stats are introduced for listener, ``downstream_peek_remote_close`` and ``read_error`` :ref:`listener stats <config_listener_stats>`.

minor_behavior_changes:
- area: thrift
  change: |
    add validate_clusters in :ref:`RouteConfiguration <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.network.thrift_proxy.v3.RouteConfiguration>` to override the default behavior of cluster validation.
- area: tls
  change: |
    if both :ref:`match_subject_alt_names <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.match_subject_alt_names>` and :ref:`match_typed_subject_alt_names <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.match_typed_subject_alt_names>` are specified, the former (deprecated) field is ignored. Previously, setting both fields would result in an error.
- area: tls
  change: |
    removed SHA-1 cipher suites from the server-side defaults.
- area: http
  change: |
    the behavior of the :ref:`timeout <envoy_v3_api_field_config.core.v3.KeepaliveSettings.timeout>`
    field has been modified to extend the timeout when *any* frame is received on the owning HTTP/2
    connection. This negates the effect of head-of-line (HOL) blocking for slow connections. If
    any frame is received the assumption is that the connection is working. This behavior change
    can be reverted by setting the ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_delay_keepalive_timeout`` runtime
    flag to false.
- area: lua
  change: |
    export symbols of LuaJit by default on Linux. This is useful in cases where you have a lua script
    that loads shared object libraries, such as those installed via luarocks.
