    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/27702) that caused ADS initialization
    to fail on the first attempt and set a back-off retry interval of up to 1 second, if ADS is
    using an Envoy Cluster for the backend. The issue was fixed to ensure that ADS initialization
    happens after the Envoy Cluster it depends upon has been properly initialized. ADS that does
    not depend on an Envoy Cluster (i.e. GoogleGrpc) is not affected by this change.

    Fixed content_length related issues when body mutation by external processor is enabled. ext_proc filter removes the content
    length header in 1)STREAMED BodySendMode 2) BUFFERED_PARTIAL BodySendMode and 3) BUFFERED BodySendMode + SKIP HeaderSendMode.
    This will enable chunked-encoding whenever feasible in HTTP1.1. Besides, ext_proc filter keep content length header
    in BUFFERED BodySendMode + SEND HeaderSendMode. It is now external processor's responsibility to set the content length
    correctly matched to the mutated body. if those two doesn't match, the mutation will be rejected and local reply with error
    status will be returned.
