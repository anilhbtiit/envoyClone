behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*
- area: http
  change: |
    Remove the hop by hop TE header from downstream request headers. This change can be temporarily reverted
    by setting ``envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_te`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    Flip runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.no_downgrade_to_canonical_name`` to true. Name downgrading in the
    per filter config searching will be disabled by default. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting
    the flag to false explicitly.
    See doc :ref:`Http filter route specific config <arch_overview_http_filters_per_filter_config>` or
    issue https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/29461 for more specific detail and examples.
- area: listener
  change: |
    undeprecated runtime key ``overload.global_downstream_max_connections`` until :ref:`downstream connections monitor
    <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.resource_monitors.downstream_connections.v3.DownstreamConnectionsConfig>` extension becomes stable.
- area: stats dns_filter
  change: |
    Fixed tag extraction so that :ref:`stat_prefix <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.udp.dns_filter.v3.DnsFilterConfig>`
    is properly extracted. This changes the Prometheus name from
    dns_filter_myprefix_local_a_record_answers{} to dns_filter_local_a_record_answers{envoy.dns_filter_prefix="myprefix"}.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Changes the default value of ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_use_oghttp2`` to true. This changes the codec used for HTTP/2
    requests and responses. This behavior can be reverted by setting the feature to false.
- area: http2
  change: |
    Discard the ``Host`` header if the ``:authority`` header was received to bring Envoy into compliance with
    https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#section-8.3.1 This behavioral change can be reverted by setting runtime flag
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.http2_discard_host_header`` to false.
