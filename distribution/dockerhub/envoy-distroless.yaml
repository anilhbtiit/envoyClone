    The distroless image provides the smallest, most lightweight and most secure way to run Envoy in a container.

    Based upon the [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) "nonroot/nossl" images, this
    image contain only the statically compiled Envoy binary and its glibc dependencies.

    Envoy is run as non-root in a container with the most minimal possible attack surface.
