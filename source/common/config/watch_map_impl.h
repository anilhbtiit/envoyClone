// Manages "watches" of xDS resources. Several xDS callers might ask for a subscription to the same
// resource name "X". The xDS machinery must return to each their very own subscription to X.
// The xDS machinery's "watch" concept accomplishes that, while avoiding parallel redundant xDS
// requests for X. Each of those subscriptions is viewed as a "watch" on X, while behind the scenes
// there is just a single real subscription to that resource name.
//
// This class maintains the watches<-->subscription mapping: it
// 1) delivers updates to all interested watches, and
// 2) tracks which resource names should be {added to,removed from} the subscription when the
//    {first,last} watch on a resource name is {added,removed}.
//
// #1 is accomplished by WatchMap's implementation of the SubscriptionCallbacks interface.
// This interface allows the xDS client to just throw each xDS update message it receives directly
// into WatchMap::onConfigUpdate, rather than having to track the various watches' callbacks.
//
// The information for #2 is returned by updateWatchInterest(); the caller should use it to
// update the subscription accordingly.
//
// A WatchMap is assumed to be dedicated to a single type_url type of resource (EDS, CDS, etc).
