  change: |
    Fixed content_length related issues when body mutation by external processor is enabled. ext_proc filter removes the content
    length header in 1)STREAMED BodySendMode 2) BUFFERED_PARTIAL BodySendMode and 3) BUFFERED BodySendMode + SKIP HeaderSendMode.
    This will enable chunked-encoding whenever feasible in HTTP1.1. Besides, ext_proc filter keep content length header
    in BUFFERED BodySendMode + SEND HeaderSendMode. It is now external processor's responsibility to set the content length
    correctly matched to the mutated body.
