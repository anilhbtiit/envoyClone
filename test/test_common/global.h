 * Instead we use self-cleaning singletons.
 *
 * Say for example you need a FooImpl plumbed through the system. In production
 * code you must propagate a FooImpl through constructors to provide access
 * where needed. For tests, everywhere a common FooImpl is required,
 * instantiate:
 *
 *   Global<FooImpl> foo;
 *
 * You can ghen access the singleton FooImpl via foo.get(). The underlying
 * FooImpl is ref-counted, and when the last TestGlobal is freed, the singleton
 * FooImpl will be destructed and the singleton pointer nulled.
 *
 * The templated type must have a zero-arg constructor. Templatizing this on an
 * int will compile, but will be hard to use as the memory will be uninitialized
 * and you will not know when instantiating it whether it needs to be
 * initialized.
