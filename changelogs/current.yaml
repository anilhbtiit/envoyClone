- area: eds
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.multiplex_eds`` to disable eds multiplexing. Eds multiplexing is enabled by default, so that all subscriptions for the same resource type and management server reuse a single channel/mux.
    When eds multiplexing is disabled each subscription uses a dedicated channel/mux.
