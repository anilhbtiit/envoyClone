1.15.0 (Pending)
================

Changes
-------

* access loggers: added GRPC_STATUS operator on logging format.
* fault: added support for controlling the percentage of requests that abort, delay and response rate limits faults 
  are applied to using :ref:`HTTP headers <config_http_filters_fault_injection_http_header>` to the HTTP fault filter.
* http: fixed a bug where the upgrade header was not cleared on responses to non-upgrade requests.
  Can be reverted temporarily by setting runtime feature `envoy.reloadable_features.fix_upgrade_response` to false.
* request_id: added to :ref:`always_set_request_id_in_response setting <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.always_set_request_id_in_response>`
  to set :ref:`x-request-id <config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>` header in response even if
  tracing is not forced.
* tracing: tracing configuration has been made fully dynamic and every HTTP connection manager
  can now have a separate :ref:`tracing provider <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.provider>`.

Deprecated
----------

* Tracing provider configuration as part of :ref:`bootstrap config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.tracing>`
  has been deprecated in favor of configuration as part of :ref:`HTTP connection manager
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.provider>`.
