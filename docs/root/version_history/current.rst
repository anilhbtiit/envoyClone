Incompatible Behavior Changes
-----------------------------
*Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* aws_request_signing: requests are now buffered by default to compute signatures which include the
  payload hash, making the filter compatible with most AWS services. Previously, requests were
  never buffered, which only produced correct signatures for requests without a body, or for
  requests to S3, ES or Glacier, which used the literal string ``UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD``. Buffering can
  be now be disabled in favor of using unsigned payloads with compatible services via the new
  `use_unsigned_payload` filter option (default false).
