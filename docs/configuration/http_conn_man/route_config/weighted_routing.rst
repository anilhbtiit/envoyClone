.. _config_http_conn_man_route_table_weighted_routing:

Traffic splitting across multiple upstreams
===========================================

Envoy's router can split traffic to a route in a virtual host across
multiple upstream clusters. There are two common use cases. The first use
case is version upgrades, where traffic to a route is shifted gradually
from one cluster to another. The
:ref:`traffic shifting <config_http_conn_man_route_table_traffic_shifting>`
describes this scenario in more detail.

The second use case, discussed in this section, is A/B testing or multivariate
testing, where ``two or more versions`` of the same service are tested simultaneously.
The traffic to the route has to be *split* between clusters running different versions
of the same service.

Consider a simple example ``service`` with three versions (v1, v2 and
v3). Envoy provides two ways to split traffic evenly across the three
versions (i.e., ``33%, 33%, 34%``):

.. _config_http_conn_man_route_table_weighted_routing_percentages:

(a) Weight-based cluster selection
----------------------------------

The first option is to use a **single** :ref:`route <config_http_conn_man_route_table_route>` with 
:ref:`weighted_clusters <config_http_conn_man_route_table_route_weighted_clusters>`,
where multiple upstream cluster targets are specified for a single route,
along with weights that indicate the **percentage** of traffic to be sent
to each upstream cluster.

    {
      "route_config": {
        "virtual_hosts": [
          {
            "name": "service",
            "domains": ["*"],
            "routes": [
              {
                "prefix": "/",
                "weighted_clusters": {
                  "runtime_key_prefix" : "routing.traffic_split.service",
                  "clusters" : [
                    { "name" : "service_v1", "weight" : 33 },
                    { "name" : "service_v2", "weight" : 33 },
                    { "name" : "service_v3", "weight" : 34 }
                  ]
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

The weights assigned to each cluster can be dynamically adjusted using the
following runtime variables: ``routing.traffic_split.service.service_v1``,
``routing.traffic_split.service.service_v2`` and
``routing.traffic_split.service.service_v3``.

.. _config_http_conn_man_route_table_weighted_routing_probabilities:

(b) Probabilistic route selection
---------------------------------

The second option is to use **multiple** :ref:`routes <config_http_conn_man_route_table_route>`
with :ref:`runtimes <config_http_conn_man_route_table_route_runtime>` that specify the
**probability** of selecting a route.
Since Envoy matches routes with a :ref:`first match <config_http_conn_man_route_table_route_matching>`
policy, the related routes (one for each upstream cluster) must be placed back-to-back,
along with a runtime in all but the last route.

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "route_config": {
        "virtual_hosts": [
          {
            "name": "service",
            "domains": ["*"],
            "routes": [
              {
                "prefix": "/",
                "cluster": "service_v1",
                "runtime": {
                  "key": "routing.traffic_split.service.service_v1",
                  "default": 33
                }
              },
              {
                "prefix": "/",
                "cluster": "service_v2",
                "runtime": {
                  "key": "routing.traffic_split.service.service_v2",
                  "default": 50
                }
              },
              {
                "prefix": "/",
                "cluster": "service_v3",
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

In the configuration above,

1. ``routing.traffic_split.service.service_v1`` is set to ``33``, so that there is a
   *33\% probability* that the v1 route will be selected by Envoy.
2. ``routing.traffic_split.service.service_v2`` is set to ``50``, so that if the v1 route
   is not selected, between v2 and v3, there is a *50\% probability* that the v2 route will
   be selected by Envoy. If v2 is not selected the traffic falls through to the v3 route.

This distribution of probabilities ensures that the traffic will be split evenly across
all three routes (i.e. ``33%, 33%, 34%``).
