  change: |
    added support for intermediate CA as trusted ca. The peer certificate issued by an intermediate CA will be trusted with
    setting valid partial chain in trusted ca, which can not be verified without trusting its ancestor root CA(full chain in trsuted ca)
    previously. :ref:`trust_ca<envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.trusted_ca>`.

  change: |
    changed behavior of the fixed heap monitor to count pages allocated to TCMalloc as free memory if it's not used by Envoy. This change can be reverted temporarily by setting the runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.do_not_count_mapped_pages_as_free`` to true.
- area: prometheus_stats
  change: |
    removed blank line for being compatible with OpenMetrics.
