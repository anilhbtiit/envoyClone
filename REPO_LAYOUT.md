# Repository layout overview

This is a high level overview of how the repository is laid out to both aid in code investigation,
as well as to clearly specify how extensions are added to the repository. The top level directories
are:

* `.circleci/`:
* `bazel/`:
* `ci/`:
* `configs/`:
* `docs/`:
* `examples/`:
* `include/`:
* `restarter/`:
* `source/`:
* `support/`:
* `test/`:
* `tools/`:
