new_features:
- area: header_formatters
  change: |
    all access log formatters can be used as custom request/response headers. Custom header's syntax is parsed using access logger's parser and
    header values are obtained using access log's substitution formatters. This feature can be reversed by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.unified_header_formatter`` to false.
- area: http
  change: |
    made the :ref:`admission control <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.admission_control.v3.AdmissionControl>` work as an upstream filter.
- area: http
  change: |
    added default-false ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_use_balsa_parser`` for experimental BalsaParser.
- area: http
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_upstream_filters`` for experimental upstream filters.

    added support for :ref:`choose_first<envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.compressor.v3.Compressor>`.
- area: cors
  change: |
    added support for cors PNA. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy_reloadable_features_cors_private_network_access`` to false. More details refer to https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-preflight.
- area: upstream
  change: |
    added a filter state object to control the destination address in :ref:`ORIGINAL_DST clusters <arch_overview_load_balancing_types_original_destination_request_header_filter_state>`.

- area: health check
  change: |
    added :ref:`thrift health check <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.health_checkers.thrift.v3.Thrift>` as a :ref:`custom health check <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.HealthCheck.CustomHealthCheck>`.
- area: access_log
  change: |
    updated command operator ``%GRPC_STATUS%`` to suppoprt the snake case.
- area: redis
  change: |

- area: lua
  change: |
    added new headers method "setHttp1ReasonPhrase" for lua filter, please see :ref:`lua header wrapper <config_http_filters_lua_header_wrapper>`.
