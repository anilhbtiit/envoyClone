    Flip runtime flag ``envoy.reloadable_features.no_downgrade_to_canonical_name`` to true. Name downgrading in the
    per filter config searching will be disabled by default. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting
    the flag to false explicitly.
    See doc :ref:`Http filter route specific config <arch_overview_http_filters_per_filter_config>` or
    issue https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/29461 for more specific detail and examples.

    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/27702) that caused ADS initialization
    to fail on the first attempt and set a back-off retry interval of up to 1 second, if ADS is
    using an Envoy Cluster for the backend. The issue was fixed to ensure that ADS initialization
    happens after the Envoy Cluster it depends upon has been properly initialized. ADS that does
    not depend on an Envoy Cluster (i.e. GoogleGrpc) is not affected by this change.

  change: |
    Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
