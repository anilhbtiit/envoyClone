Getting help
============

We are very interested in building a community around Envoy. Please reach out to us if you are
interested in using it and need help or want to contribute.

Google Groups
-------------

* `envoy-announce <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/envoy-announce>`_: Low frequency mailing
  list where we will email announcements only.
* `envoy-users <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/envoy-users>`_: General user discussion.
* `envoy-dev <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/envoy-dev>`_: Envoy developer discussion
  (APIs, feature design, etc.).

IRC
---

* `#lyft-envoy <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lyft-envoy>`_
* `lyft/envoy on Gitter <https://gitter.im/lyft/envoy>`_

Feel free to drop into either Gitter or the IRC channel for any reason, even
if just to chat. It doesn't matter which one you join, the messages are sync'd
between the two.

Reporting security vulnerabilities
----------------------------------

If you've found a vulnerability or a potential vulnerability in Envoy please let us know at
security@lyft.com. We'll send a confirmation email to acknowledge your report, and we'll send an
additional email when we've identified the issue positively or negatively.
