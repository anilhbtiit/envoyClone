 * reference-counted so that no-longer-used symbols can be reclaimed.
 *
 * We use a uint8_t array to encode arrays of symbols in order to conserve
 * space, as in practice the majority of token instances in stat names draw from
 * a fairly small set of common names, typically less than 100. The format is
 * somewhat similar to UTF-8, with a variable-length array of uint8_t. See the
 * implementation for details.
 *
 * StatNameStorage can be used to manage memory for the byte-encoding. Not all
 * StatNames are backed by StatNameStorage -- the storage may be inlined into
 * another object such as HeapStatData. StaNameStorage is not fully RAII --
 * instead the owner must call free(SymbolTable&) explicitly before
 * StatNameStorage is destructed. This saves 8 bytes of storage per stat.
 *
 * A StatName is a copyable and assignable reference to this storage. It does
 * not own the storage or keep it alive via reference counts; the owner must
 * ensure the backing store lives as long as the StatName.
 *
 * The underlying Symbol / SymbolVec data structures are private to the
 * impl. One side effect of the non-monotonically-increasing symbol counter is
 * that if a string is encoded, the resulting stat is destroyed, and then that
 * same string is re-encoded, it may or may not encode to the same underlying
 * symbol.
