Rate limit
==========

Global rate limiting :ref:`architecture overview <arch_overview_rate_limit>`.

The HTTP rate limit filter will call the rate limit service when the request's route has the
*global* property set in the :ref:`rate limit configuration
<config_http_conn_man_route_table_route_rate_limit>`.

If the rate limit service is called, and the response for any of the descriptors is over limit, a
429 response is returned.

    "name": "rate_limit",
    "config": {
      "domain": "...",
      "actions": []
    }
  }

domain
  *(required, string)* The rate limit domain to use when calling the rate limit service.

actions
  *(required, array)* An array of rate limiting actions to perform. Multiple actions can be
  specified. The supported action types are documented below.

Actions
-------

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "type": "..."
  }

type
  *(required, string) The type of rate limit action to perform. The currently supported action
  type is *service_to_service*.

Service to service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "type": "service_to_service"
  }

The following descriptors are sent:

  * ("to_cluster", "<:ref:`route target cluster <config_http_conn_man_route_table_route_cluster>`>")
  * ("to_cluster", "<:ref:`route target cluster <config_http_conn_man_route_table_route_cluster>`>"),
    ("from_cluster", "<local service cluster>")

<local service cluster> is derived from the :option:`--service-cluster` option.

Statistics
----------

The buffer filter outputs statistics in the *cluster.<route target cluster>.ratelimit.* namespace.
429 responses are emitted to the normal cluster :ref:`dynamic HTTP statistics
<config_cluster_manager_cluster_stats_dynamic_http>`.

  error, Counter, Total errors contacting the rate limit service
  over_limit, Counter, total over limit responses from the rate limit service

Runtime
-------

The HTTP rate limit filter supports the following runtime settings:

ratelimit.http_filter_enabled
  % of requests that will call the rate limit service. Defaults to 100.

ratelimit.http_filter_enforcing
  % of requests that will call the rate limit service and enforce the decision. Defaults to 100.
  This can be used to test what would happen before fully enforcing the outcome.
