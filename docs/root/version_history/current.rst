1.18.0 (April 15, 2021)
=======================

Minor Behavior Changes
----------------------
*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*

* http: replaced setting `envoy.reloadable_features.strict_1xx_and_204_response_headers` with settings
  `envoy.reloadable_features.require_strict_1xx_and_204_response_headers`
  (require upstream 1xx or 204 responses to not have Transfer-Encoding or non-zero Content-Length headers) and
  `envoy.reloadable_features.send_strict_1xx_and_204_response_headers`
  (do not send 1xx or 204 responses with these headers). Both are true by default.

Bug Fixes
---------

code: fixed some whitespace to make fix_format happy.
