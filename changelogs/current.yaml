- area: http cookies
  change: |
    Changed internal format of http cookie to protobuf and added expiry timestamp. Processing expired cookie
    results in selection of a new upstream host and sending a new cookie to the client. Previous format of
    the cookie is still accepted, but is planned to be obsoleted in the future.
    This behavior change can be reverted by setting
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.stateful_session_encode_ttl_in_cookie`` to ``false``.
