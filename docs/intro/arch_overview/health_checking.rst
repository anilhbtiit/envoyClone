Health checking
===============

Active health checking can be :ref:`configured <config_cluster_manager_cluster_hc>` on a per
upstream cluster basis. As described in the :ref:`service discovery
<arch_overview_service_discovery>` section, active health checking and the SDS service discovery
type go hand in hand. However, there are other scenarios where active health checking is desired
even when using the other service discovery types. Envoy supports two different types of health
checking along with various settings (check interval, failures required before marking a host
unhealthy, successes required before marking a host healthy, etc.):

* **HTTP**: During HTTP health checking Envoy will send an HTTP request to the upstream host. It
  expects a 200 response if the host is healthy. The upstream host can return 503 if it wants to
  immediately notify downstream hosts to no longer forward traffic to it.
* **L3/L4**: During L3/L4 health checking, Envoy will send a configurable byte buffer to the 
  upstream host. It expects the byte buffer to be echoed in the response if the host is to be
  considered healthy.

HTTP health checking filter
---------------------------

When an Envoy mesh is deployed with active health checking between clusters, a large amount of
health checking traffic can be generated. Envoy includes an HTTP health checking filter that can be
installed in a configured HTTP listener. This filter is capable of a few different modes of
operation:

* **No pass through**: In this mode, the health check request is never passed to the local service.
  Envoy will respond with a 200 or a 503 depending on the current draining state of the server.
* **Pass through**: In this mode, Envoy will pass every health check request to the local service.
  The service is expected to return a 200 or a 503 depending on its health state.
* **Pass through with caching**: In this mode, Envoy will pass health check requests to the local
  service, but then cache the result for some period of time. Subsequent health check requests will
  return the cached value up to the cache time. When the cache time is reached, the next health
  check request will be passed to the local service. This is the recommended mode of operation when
  operating a large mesh. Envoy uses persistent connections for health checking traffic and health
  check requests have very little cost to Envoy itself. Thus, this mode of operation yields an
  eventually consistent view of the health state of each upstream host without overwhelming the 
  local service with a large number of health check requests.

The health check filter appends the x-envoy-upstream-healthchecked-cluster header to the response 
headers, the value is determined by the :option:`--service-cluster` command line option.

Health check filter :ref:`configuration <config_http_filters_health_check>`.
