# Process for becoming a maintainer

## Your organization is not yet a maintainer

* Express interest to the senior maintainers that your organization is interested in becoming a
  maintainer. Becoming a maintainer generally means that you are going to be spending substantial
  time (>25%) on Envoy for the foreseeable future. You should have domain expertise and be extremely
  proficient in C++. Ultimately your goal is to become a senior maintainer that will represent your
  organization.
* We will expect you to start contributing increasingly complicated PRs, under the guidance
  of the existing senior maintainers.
* We may ask you to do some PRs from our backlog.
* As you gain experience with the code base and our standards, we will ask you to do code reviews
  for incoming PRs (i.e., all maintainers are expected to shoulder a proportional share of
  community reviews).
* After a period of approximately 2-3 months of working together and making sure we see eye to eye,
  the existing senior maintainers will confer and decide whether to grant maintainer status or not.
  We make no guarantees on the length of time this will take, but 2-3 months is the approximate
  goal.

## Your organization is currently a maintainer

* First decide whether your organization really needs more people with maintainer access. Valid
  reasons are "blast radius", a large organization that is working on multiple unrelated projects,
  etc.
* Contact a senior maintainer for your organization and express interest.
* Start doing PRs and code reviews under the guidance of your senior maintainer.
* After a period of 1-2 months the existing senior maintainers will discuss granting "standard"
  maintainer access.
* "Standard" maintainer access can be upgraded to "senior" maintainer access after another 1-2
  months of work and another conference of the existing senior maintainers.

# Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the maintainers can be
called in to decide an issue. If the maintainers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each senior maintainer
receives two votes and each normal maintainer receives one vote.

# Adding new projects to the envoyproxy GitHub organization

New projects will be added to the envoyproxy organization via GitHub issue discussion in one of the
existing projects in the organization. Once sufficient discussion has taken place (~3-5 business
days but depending on the volume of conversation), the maintainers will decide whether the new
project should be added (see the section above on voting if the maintainers cannot easily decide).
